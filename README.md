This repo contains the work done for APPM 4600 by Derek Walker at least for Lab 1.

Its directory structure looks like "Homeworks\" and "Labs\" where the Homeworks directory contains code implemented for Homeworks in APPM 4600, and the Labs directory contains subfolders for each lab and the code associated with each lab.

Currently, there is the code for Lab 1 under the "Labs\Lab 1" directory. This contains all the code done for Lab 1 including the new version of testDot.py.
In the future, there may be additions for Lab 3, Lab 4, and so on... Lab 2 may not have any code associated with it as it's about creating and sharing this repo.

As for anything else, it may be added to this README.md for easy access to FAQs or any new added directories for this repo.
